# Game Recommendation System

This repository contains a Python script for a Game Recommendation System built using Streamlit. The recommendation system utilizes K-Means clustering and cosine similarity to suggest games based on various features such as categories, themes, popularity, and more.

### Description
The script app.py implements a Game Recommendation System that allows users to input their preferred games and receive recommendations based on similar games. The recommendation is generated using K-Means clustering and cosine similarity metrics.

### Features

**Recommendation Generation:** Upon selecting games, users can generate recommendations based on similarities in categories, themes, popularity, and more.

**Interactive UI:** The user interface provides an intuitive experience, allowing users to interact with the system effortlessly.

**Image Display:** Game recommendations are accompanied by images fetched from online sources.

### File Structure
**app.py:** Main Python script containing the recommendation system implementation.

**st_files_connection.py:** File for Streamlit file connection.

**requirements.txt:** List of Python dependencies.

**README.md:** Documentation file providing information about the project.

## Acknowledgments
This project utilizes Streamlit for creating interactive web applications.
